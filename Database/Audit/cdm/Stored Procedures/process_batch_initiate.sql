OBJECT: cdm.process_batch_initiate

DESCRIPTION: Given a Data Management Process UID this procedure initiates a new process batch.

PARAMETERS:

  @process_uid INT = Text that uniquely identifies the Data Management process.
 
  @workflow_name VARCHAR(200) = Name of the workflow (encapsulated code) that executes the process.
 
  @workflow_guid VARCHAR(100) = Unique identifier of the workflow (encapsulated code) that executes the process.
 
  @workflow_version VARCHAR(20) = Version of the workflow (encapsulated code) that executes the process.

  @channel VARCHAR(100) = The channel through which this data came into the system. Typically not specified. May be
    used when data comes in on file feeds (channel = file name) or when there are multiple source system instances
    loaded through a single workflow.
 
  @internal_sequence_ind BIT Optional = Flag that indicates whether to use the last successfully Completed Batch Key as the End Sequence Key.
    This creates efficiency by looking up the Completed Batch Key in the control tables rather than requiring it to be provided
    by the calling code.
 
  @increment_sequence_ind BIT Optional = Flag that indicates whether the Start Sequence Key is 
    incremented by one (1) over the previous End Sequence Key. 
 
  @current_sequence_key INT Optional = Integer value representing the current value (typically a maximum) 
    of the sequence key referenced by the source table.
  
  @current_sequence_dtm DATETIME Optional = Datetime value representing the current value
    (typically database server timestamp) of the Sequence Datetime referenced by the source table.
  
  @limit_process_uid VARCHAR(50) Optional = Identifier of a Data Management Process whose End Sequence Key is used to limit the
    returned End Sequence Key of the primary process.  The lesser of the two End Sequence Keys is returned.

  @comments VARCHAR(200) Optional = Comments to be applied to the new process batch.
  
OUTPUT PARAMETERS: None.
  
RETURN VALUE:

  process_batch_key INT = Key identifying the new process batch.

RETURN DATASET:

  NOTE: Only a single record will be returned.

  process_batch_key INT = Key identifying the new process batch.
  initiate_dtm DATETIME = Datetime the process batch was initiated.
  initiate_dtm_text CHAR(23) = Text representation of the Initiated Datetime, having the format CONVERT(char(23),<<datetime>>,121)
  begin_sequence_key BIGINT = Integer value representing the start of the range to be considered in processing the batch.
  begin_sequence_dtm DATETIME = Datetime value representing the start of the range to be considered in processing the batch.
  begin_sequence_dtm_text CHAR(23) = Text representation of the Start Sequence Datetime, having the format CONVERT(char(23),<<datetime>>,121)
  end_sequence_key BIGINT = Integer value representing the end of the range to be considered in processing the batch.
  end_sequence_dtm DATETIME = Datetime value representing the end of the range to be considered in processing the batch.
  end_sequence_dtm_text CHAR(23) = Text representation of the End Sequence Datetime, having the format CONVERT(char(23),<<datetime>>,121)
